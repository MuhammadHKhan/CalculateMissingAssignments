# CalculateMissingAssignments

  This program opens two files, the first file
  contains the list of studnets and the second file
  cotains the list of Assignments each student has completed.
  There were a total of nine assignments, so if a student's 
  assignment does not appear in the list, it counts as missing.
  To do this, we will use unordered maps to figure out how many
  missing assignments each student has.
